Whirligig Blade Designer

A precision engineering tool built for artisans and makers to design balanced whirligig propellers. This web application calculates the fluid-dynamic balance and physics of a single blade, ensuring your wind-ornaments start easily and maintain momentum.

✨ Features

Dual Design Modes: Switch between classic Vintage Leaf (aviation style) and Modern Rounded profiles.

Physics Engine: Real-time calculation of Center of Gravity (CG) and Moment of Inertia (Flywheel Rating).

The "Sweet Spot": Visual crosshair and green zone targeting the 35%–42% CG range required for professional performance.

Manufacturing Exports:

Laser SVG: Direct-to-laser vector file with configurable Kerf Offset.

Scale JPG: High-resolution (150 DPI) printable template with a physical scale bar for manual cutting.

Hybrid Hub Support: Integrated logic for mechanical pin holes and tab sizing for 3D printed hubs.

Dual Units: Seamlessly toggle between Imperial (Inches) and Metric (Millimeters).

🛠️ How to Use

Geometry: Adjust the Exposed Length and Widths to fit your project size.

Fine-Tuning: Use the Sharpness and Swell Position sliders to move the red crosshair into the Green "Sweet Spot".

Production: Input your laser's Kerf (usually 0.005in) to ensure a perfect friction fit into your hub slots.

Export: Use the Export SVG for laser cutting or Export JPG for paper templates.

📐 Physics Principles

A whirligig's performance is governed by the balance between Starting Torque and Momentum.

Balanced (38%): Best all-around performance.

Snappy: Low inertia, starts spinning in a whisper of wind.

High Coast: High inertia, acts as a flywheel to spin through wind lulls.

🚀 Technical Requirements

This is a self-contained React component using Tailwind CSS and Lucide Icons. It can be run in any modern React environment or exported as a standalone static tool.
